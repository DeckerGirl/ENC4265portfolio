Homepage:For my About Me section, I used Grammarly for spellcheck.

Reflection blog #1 Wayback Analysis: I have not yet used any AI for this Reflection post. 

Reflection blog #2 Quick Start Guide: As this is a vintage assignment, I did not use AI for this reflective blog.

Reflection blog #3 Prompt A: I have not used AI for this assignment.

Manual Assessment Memo: I used Grammarly for spellcheck. ChatGBT was used to generate the text of this assignment from the prompt "I evaluated the Reebok T7.8 treadmill manual and it had these strengths: multi-linguial, detailed, and very accessible. These weaknesses: crowded visually and sometimes grammatically confusing. I recommend reformatting with white space and bullet points and reviewing grammatical errors."  

Reflection blog #4 Prompt C: For this reflection I entered the following prompt into ChatGBT: "Generate a detailed project proposal for a front-end developer working on a web application redesign for a comapny called LuLuDesign". I thought the output was too dense so I stacked the existing prompt with: " - Remove any tables and shorten this project purposal"
