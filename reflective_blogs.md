# Wayback Analysis
For this assignment I chose to analyze the design of a amazon webpage from 2005.

The first thing I noticed was how crowded with information and ads Amazon’s homepage was. While the basic structure was in place—a search bar at the top center, product recommendations, and categories—everything seemed to be competing for attention. TThe top of the page had a horizontal navigation bar with categories like "Books," "Electronics," and "Clothing," but it wasn’t as intuitive or easy to navigate as current designs. I had to read everything carefully and sift through tdifferent features to find what I was looking for. I think the utilitarian fonts added to this confusion. Nothing was bolded or highlighted to stand out more in the sea of information. Maybe with the exception of promotional ads (something amazon decided placementon but not design). Otherwise the site was lacking in graphics.

The promotional bannersfeatured under product reccomendations stuck out slightly more with their white-text-on-blue back design. It detailed options, including an advertisement for Amazon’s own credit card and other promotional banners. I beleive the overwhelmingly white background used for this site's design coupled with the use of light blue text links, washes out information and makes the site difficult to navigate. There's too much white space and the text doesn't stand out enough against it.

Today, Amazon uses a cleaner, more dynamic layout that focuses more on user intent and behavior rather than overwhelming them with too many options upfront.

# Quick Start Guide
For this assignment I chose to make a quick start guide for an electric kettle.

## Assignment Rationale 
This assignment will let you experiment with a generative AI tool of your choice, and you will strengthen your critical thinking skills as you evaluate its strengths and weaknesses.

## Where to Start
Think of a product that you already know how to use. It can be a bluetooth headset, an app, a video game, a sewing machine, or anything that requires a little bit of setup to use.

## Assignment Steps
This assignment is a little more structured than others in our course, so please follow these steps:
1. Open Copilot or any other text-based generative AI tool you prefer (don't pay for it unless you happen to already have a subscription)
2. Write a prompt that asks it to generate a quick-start guide for your product of choice. (copy and paste this somewhere - it is part of what you need to turn in)
3. Evaluate the output. Try to follow the steps yourself, or at least imagine following them.
4. Prompt it again (and again) if needed (again saving your prompts somewhere).
5. Reflect on the process and write a short (200 words) reflection on the tool's strengths, weaknesses, and anything that you learned (or anything that surprised you).

## What is Due
On your portfolio, post the following:
-The name of the tool (with the link if you have it)
-Your prompts
-The best output 
-Your reflection
