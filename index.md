# Welcome to my Digital Portfolio 

## About Amber Spath 

I am a transfer IT student at the University of Central Florida (UCF) with a strong interest in UI/UX and a solid coding foundation. I am currently looking for a part-time tech job. As mention, I tend to favor front-end design over back-end software work but I am trying to broaden my horizions with independant study this semester.  My IT experience is mostly from independant projects with the exception of freelance technician work I did for an old employer while I was working at her Bakery. I aided her in setting up and configuring a new computer system for the company alongside integrating existing company emails. Occasionally, she would also call me in for other IT related issues. 
I like to think I have a diverse work background for someone my age. My period at the bakery was from a two-to-three-year period where I was taking time off school to work. I started as a barista and waitress and later was promoted to being one of their two main Bakers. Prior to this, I have worked as catering staff for an event planner, as a hostess at a seafood bar, and as a worker at a daycare. I really credit my experience in the restaurant business for teaching me the value of flexibility in conjunction with hard work and being able to effectively collaborate with customers and co-workers. It taught me how to think on my feet, come up with creative solutions, and work really well with others. I hope to transfer these skills into a design-based IT job after I graduate.
