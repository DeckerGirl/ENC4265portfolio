# Welcome to my Digital Portfolio 

## About Me 

My name is Amber Spath, and I'm a transfer IT student at UCF. I'm currently looking for a part-time tech job. I have a lot of independent experience with coding, but I tend to favor UI&UX over back-end software work. I don't have any work experience in IT, except for freelance technician work I did for an old employer while I was working at her Bakery. This was a two-to-three-year period where I was taking time off school to work. I started as a barista and waitress and later was promoted to being one of their main Bakers. Prior to this, I've worked as catering staff for an event planner and as a hostess at a seafood bar. I really credit my experience in the restaurant business for teaching me the value of flexibility in conjunction with hard work and being able to effectively collaborate with customers and co-workers. I hope to transfer these skills into a design-based IT job after I graduate.
