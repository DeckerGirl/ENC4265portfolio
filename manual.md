### 1. Introduction to GitHub & GitHub Pages 

GitHub is a cloud-based platform where developers store code, collaborate on projects, and manage version control using Git. GitHub Pages is a free feature that allows you to publish static websites directly from your GitHub repository. 

### 2. Why Use GitHub Pages? 

    - Free Hosting: No cost for hosting simple HTML/CSS/JS websites 

    - Perfect for Portfolios: Show off projects, resumes, blogs 

    -  No Server Management: Everything is served as static content 

    - Version Control: Easily roll back to previous versions 
    
### 3. Getting Started with GitHub 

    1. Go to github.com 

    2. Create an account (free) 

    3. Set your username, email, and password 

    4. Verify your email and log in 

### 4. Creating Your First Repository 

    1. Click the + in the top-right and select New Repository 

    2. Name it (e.g., my-portfolio) 

    3. Add a description (optional) 

    4. Choose Public or Private 

    5. Check Initialize this repo with a README 

    6. Click Create Repository 

### 5. Understanding Branches & Commits 

    - Branch: A version of your project. The default is usually main. 

    - Commit: A snapshot of your code. Each time you make changes, write a message like "Added homepage layout" and commit them. 

    - Use Pull Requests to merge changes from one branch to another. 

### 6. Forking Repositories and Why It Matters 

    Forking is copying someone else's repository to your own account so you can experiment or improve it. 

    Why Fork?:

    - Try out code safely 

    - Make changes and suggest improvements with Pull Requests 
    
    - Build on open-source projects 

    How to Fork: 

    - Visit any public repository 

    - Click Fork in the top right 

    - It creates a copy in your GitHub account 

    - Work on your fork without affecting the original repo 

 ### 7. Introduction to GitHub Pages Hosting 

    GitHub Pages lets you publish a website directly from your repository using the files in your main or gh-pages branch. 

    You can host: 

    -  Project Pages (in a specific repo) 

    - User Pages (from a repo named username.github.io) 

### 8. Creating a GitHub Pages Site (Step-by-Step) 

    1. Create or open your repo 

    2. Add your HTML/CSS/JS files 

    3. Go to Settings > Pages 

    4. Under "Source," select main branch (or docs/ folder) 

    5. Click Save 

    6. Your site is now live at https://yourusername.github.io/repo-name/ 
    
### 9. Using a Custom Domain with GitHub Pages 

Want to use your own domain? 

    1. Buy a domain name from a registrar (e.g., Namecheap) 

    2. In your repo, go to Settings > Pages and enter your domain 

    3. Update your DNS settings: 

        -  Add a CNAME record pointing to yourusername.github.io 

    5. Confirm in GitHub that your domain is connected 

### 10. Using Jekyll for Blog-Style Sites 

Jekyll is a static site generator built into GitHub Pages. It turns Markdown files into blog posts. 

    - Use a theme with _config.yml 

    - Create blog posts in _posts/ with the format YYYY-MM-DD-title.md 

    - Add front matter like: 

        --- 
        title: "My First Blog" 
        date: 2025-04-08 
        --- 

### 11. Theme Customization 

Choose a theme via Settings > Pages > Theme Chooser. 

Or manually set it in _config.yml: 

theme: minima 

Customize colors, fonts, and layouts with custom CSS and HTML overrides. 

### 12. Markdown Basics for GitHub Pages 

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format text easily. Itâ€™s often used in GitHub repositories, README files, and wikis. Markdown files have a .md extension and are a great way to document your projects, write blog posts, or create structured content for GitHub Pages. 

Here are some rules of thumb: 
    - # Heading 1 

    - ## Heading 2 

    - **bold**, *italic*, `code` 

    - Lists: -, *, 1. 

    - Links: [text](url) 

    - Images: ![alt text](image.jpg) 

### 13. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with GitHub Pages 

You can create fully custom sites by uploading: 

   -  .html for structure 

   -  .css for styling 

   -  .js for interactivity 

Place your code in the root or docs/ folder depending on your Pages settings. 

While Markdown is great for simple formatting, HTML is the backbone of most web content. If you want more control over the structure and layout of your GitHub Pages site, you can incorporate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Using HTML in GitHub Pages: 

GitHub Pages allows you to use standard HTML to build your site. You can create .html files and place them in your repository. Hereâ€™s a simple example of an HTML page for your GitHub Pages site: 

### 14. Project Ideas to Host with GitHub Pages 

    - Online portfolio 

    - Blog or writing journal 

    - Resume or CV 

    - JavaScript games 

    - Documentation for a class or project 

### 15. Common Errors and How to Fix Them 

    - 404 Error: Check file paths or if Pages is enabled 

    - DNS Errors: Make sure your domain is correctly configured 

    - Nothing displays: Ensure there's an index.html file in your repo 

### 16. GitHub Desktop: An Easier Way to Manage Repos 
Donâ€™t like the terminal? GitHub Desktop is a GUI for Git: 

    - Clone repos with one click 

    - Commit changes via buttons 

    - Visual diff viewer to track changes 
    
Great for beginners! 

### 17. More GitHub Features to Explore 

GitHub Actions 

Automate tasks directly from your GitHub repo, like deploying your site when you push changes. Example workflows: 

    - Automatically build and deploy a Jekyll site 

    - Lint and test code on push 

    - Schedule regular tasks 

Pull Requests 

Used to propose changes. When you fork a repo and want to contribute back: 

    - Push your changes to your fork 

    - Click New Pull Request on the original repo 

    - Maintainers can review and merge your changes 
Issues & Discussions 

Great for collaboration: 

    - Use Issues to track bugs, improvements, and tasks 

    - Use Discussions to chat with other contributors, ask questions, or gather feedback 

### GitHub Gists 

Host and share small code snippets easily. Gists can be public or private and support versioning just like regular repos. 

### Project Boards 

Kanban-style boards to track progress with To Do, In Progress, and Done columns. Use them for organizing multi-step projects or group work. 

### GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) 

Advanced users can interact with GitHub using commands like: 

gh repo clone username/repo 

Useful for scripting and automation! 

### Contributions & Insights 

Each repo has a Contributors section and analytics on commits, code frequency, and traffic. These help you track project health. 

### Pages Analytics (via 3rd-party tools) 
GitHub Pages doesnâ€™t have built-in analytics, but you can add: 

    - Google Analytics (via <script> tag in your HTML) 

    - Plausible or other privacy-friendly alternatives 

### Pinning Repositories 

You can pin your best or most active projects to your GitHub profile so visitors see them first. Go to your profile and click the "Customize your pins" button. 

### Profile README 

Add a personalized README to your GitHub profile to show off your skills, links, and current work. Create a repo named after your username to activate this feature. 
# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm a student learning web development. Welcome to my GitHub! 

### 18. Useful Resources & Communities 

  -  GitHub Docs 

  -  Pages Help 

  -  Jekyll Docs 

  -  Stack Overflow
