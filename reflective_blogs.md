# Wayback Analysis
For this assignment I chose to analyze the design of a amazon webpage from 2005. 
<center><img src="Screenshot 2025-01-23 195228.png"></center>

The first thing I noticed was how crowded with information and ads Amazon’s homepage was. While the basic structure was in place—a search bar at the top center, product recommendations, and categories—everything seemed to be competing for attention. TThe top of the page had a horizontal navigation bar with categories like "Books," "Electronics," and "Clothing," but it wasn’t as intuitive or easy to navigate as current designs. I had to read everything carefully and sift through tdifferent features to find what I was looking for. I think the utilitarian fonts added to this confusion. Nothing was bolded or highlighted to stand out more in the sea of information. Maybe with the exception of promotional ads (something amazon decided placementon but not design). Otherwise the site was lacking in graphics.

The promotional bannersfeatured under product reccomendations stuck out slightly more with their white-text-on-blue back design. It detailed options, including an advertisement for Amazon’s own credit card and other promotional banners. I beleive the overwhelmingly white background used for this site's design coupled with the use of light blue text links, washes out information and makes the site difficult to navigate. There's too much white space and the text doesn't stand out enough against it.

Today, Amazon uses a cleaner, more dynamic layout that focuses more on user intent and behavior rather than overwhelming them with too many options upfront.

# Quick Start Guide
For this assignment I chose to make a quick start guide for an electric kettle. As such this quick start guide will be targeted at consumers.
<center><img src="kettle.png"></center>

Step 1: Unbock and Inspect the Kettle.
Unbox the kettle. This kettle comes with a plug-in base, a kettle body, and a top. Take off the top and inspect the kettle for any damage or dirt. Wipe it down with a damp rag to be safe.

Step 2: Find a place for your kettle and plug-in the base. 
Decide where you desire to place your kettle. Maybe you want to keep it on the kitchen counter or a table in the office breakroom. It should be a place close to an electrical outlet. Now plug in the base.
<center><img src="kettlebase.png"></center>

Step 3: Fill Kettle with water and heat.
Take the kettle body, remove the top, and fill with water. Place the lid back on. Now place the full kettle onto the plued-in base. Push down the button by the base of the kettle handle to start the kettle.
<center><img src="waterfill.png"></center>

Step 4: Make tea or coffee.
Now that your water boiled, use it for tea or coffee in the mug of your choice!

Step 5: Maintnaince aka Descaling the Kettle.
Limescale can build up in kettles and coffe makers due to hard water. Once a month, one should fill their kettle with an inch of white vinegar ntill evaporation to break down this limescale. After this rinse out with water and use as usual.

## Assignment Rationale 
This assignment will let you experiment with a generative AI tool of your choice, and you will strengthen your critical thinking skills as you evaluate its strengths and weaknesses.

## Where to Start
Think of a product that you already know how to use. It can be a bluetooth headset, an app, a video game, a sewing machine, or anything that requires a little bit of setup to use.

## Assignment Steps
This assignment is a little more structured than others in our course, so please follow these steps:
1. Open Copilot or any other text-based generative AI tool you prefer (don't pay for it unless you happen to already have a subscription)
2. Write a prompt that asks it to generate a quick-start guide for your product of choice. (copy and paste this somewhere - it is part of what you need to turn in)
3. Evaluate the output. Try to follow the steps yourself, or at least imagine following them.
4. Prompt it again (and again) if needed (again saving your prompts somewhere).
5. Reflect on the process and write a short (200 words) reflection on the tool's strengths, weaknesses, and anything that you learned (or anything that surprised you).

## What is Due
On your portfolio, post the following:
-The name of the tool (with the link if you have it)
-Your prompts
-The best output 
-Your reflection

# Reflective Blog 3
**Prompt A:** Reflect on your assigned reading this week in a detailed manner that demonstrates you read and understood the assigned reading. What can you 'take away' from this reading? What insightful concepts did you read about that can inform your own technical communication activities? 

**Reflection:** For this reflection, I chose to focus on the assigned reading "Eight Principles of Information Architecture" by Dan Brown, because I think it provides useful guidelines for individuals getting started in web design. The reading outlines eight principles that help shape intuitive, accessible, and scalable websites. These principles are applicable not only to web design but also to broader areas of technical communication. As a student juggling multiple web design projects this semester, I found these guidlines incredibly useful and aplicable to my other classes.

One key takeaway is the Principle of Objects, which encourages designers to view content as living entities with unique characteristics and relationships. This concept reminded me that content isn't just isolated text or images but rather information that a userbase has to actively interact with.

Another insightful principle is the Principle of Choices, which highlights the importance of offering users clear and limited options. Too many choices can overwhelm users, making navigation frustrating. I realized that when I communicate technical information, simplifying choices and focusing on clarity can improve the user's understanding and experience.

The Principle of Disclosure stood out as particularly relevant to technical communication. It suggests revealing just enough information to help users decide whether to dig deeper. This principle parallels the practice of layering technical content so readers can grasp the essentials without feeling overloaded.

The Principle of Exemplars is another useful concept, as it advocates for using examples to clarify abstract categories. I've noticed that when technical documentation includes relatable examples, it becomes much easier to comprehend.

The Principle of Front Doors reminds designers that users can enter a website from any page. This principle resonated with me because it underscores the need for consistent navigation and context across all pages. Similarly, in technical communication, each section of a document should provide enough context for readers who might jump directly to that section.

The Principle of Multiple Classification suggests offering various ways to access information, recognizing that different users have different mental models. This principle is especially important in technical documentation where diverse audiences may seek information in different ways.

The Principle of Focused Navigation advocates for organizing navigation logically without mixing categories. Clear navigation parallels clear document structure, which helps users find information more efficiently.

Finally, the Principle of Growth encourages designers to build flexible structures that can accommodate future content. This principle reminded me to consider long-term scalability when organizing technical content.

Overall, Brown's principles offer practical guidance for designing user-friendly websites and technical documents alike. I found the reading insightful and applicable to my own technical communication activities, particularly in terms of structuring content thoughtfully, simplifying information for clarity, and anticipating future needs.

**Prompt C:** Ask a generative AI tool (maybe one in Boodlebox or Copilot) to generate something you might have to write in your future career. Assess the result, and then revise your prompt or "stack" an additional prompt onto it (e.g., "remove the passive voice and add headings"). Congratulations, you're a prompt engineer now. Add this skill to your resume. On your website, post: 1) your original and revised prompts 2) your assessment of what it generated 3) (optional) what it generated.<br>

**Origonal Prompt:** For this reflection I entered the following prompt into ChatGBT: "Generate a detailed project proposal for a front-end developer working on a web application redesign for a comapny called LuLuDesign"<br>

**Revised Prompt:** I thought the output was too dense so I stacked the existing prompt with: " - Remove any tables and shorten this project purposal"<br>

**Assessement:** 
The output from the original prompt was highly detailed and covered all the necessary components of a project proposal. It included sections on the project overview, objectives, scope of work, timeline, technology stack, budget estimates, and risk mitigation strategies. While the thoroughness was beneficial for a comprehensive proposal, the information felt dense and overwhelming. The inclusion of tables and multiple subheadings made it seem more formal and rigid, which could be challenging for quick comprehension or for a reader who prefers a more streamlined presentation.

Overall, the original result served its purpose by offering a full breakdown of the project, but it lacked conciseness. It would work well in contexts where stakeholders require detailed explanations and a structured approach. However, for my specific needs, where I was looking for a more digestible version, this approach was too lengthy.

The revised output was much more concise and to the point. It removed the tables, which streamlined the information significantly, making it easier to read and focus on the key aspects of the project. The proposal still maintained the essential points: objectives, scope, timeline, technologies, and budget. The overall structure was clearer, with straightforward bullet points and sections.

This version felt more appropriate for my requirements. By simplifying the content, it became more digestible without losing the critical information. It was more reader-friendly, offering a professional yet less overwhelming presentation. It demonstrated the importance of focusing on the main goals and summarizing the details, especially when preparing content for a busy audience or when space and time are limited.
General Thoughts:

Through this exercise, I learned that effective communication often requires balancing detail and brevity. As a future IT front-end developer, I can expect to communicate complex technical information to a wide range of stakeholders, and it’s crucial to tailor my output to their needs. Being able to condense a proposal into a concise and clear format without sacrificing essential details is an important skill in project management and client communication.<br>

# Reflective Blog 5

**Prompt E:** Analyze a chatbot (e.g., customer service, virtual assistant). Spend at least 5 minutes interacting with it & exploring its functionality. Then, reflect on the bot's: purpose (What is the chatbot designed to do?, functionality (how well does it perform its tasks?), user experience (was it easy to use? What were the strengths and weaknesses?), and context (how does it benefit users and the organization?)

**Reflection:** For this reflection I chose to review my own custom chatbot, Structura, from our last assignment. Structura is a custom AI chatbot built with the aim of helping users create and maintain a balanced, productive routine. It focuses on supporting individuals who struggle with time blindness, ADHD, or other challenges that impact productivity. Structura is designed to assist with organizing tasks, setting achievable goals, and providing strategies for improving focus and well-being. The bot tailors its advice to various aspects of users’ lives, such as work, study, health, creativity, social life, and mindfulness, with the ultimate goal of enhancing their daily productivity and mental clarity.
For this review, I asked Structur to layout a routine for me that would help me wake up early, maintain a workout routine, maintain a study schedule that is adhd friendly, andleave room for hobbies and reading. Below is the result I received:

"Absolutely, Amber! It sounds like you have a lot of great goals and interests, and I can help you create a routine that balances your responsibilities while incorporating strategies to manage ADHD. Here’s a suggested weekly schedule that aligns with your goals:

### Weekly Routine

**Monday to Sunday:**

**6:00 AM - Wake Up**
- Start your day with a glass of water to hydrate.
- Morning stretches/yoga (15-20 minutes) to help with tech neck and prepare for running.

**6:30 AM - Running/Workout**
- **Monday, Wednesday, Friday:** Base training runs (30-45 minutes).
- **Tuesday, Thursday:** Resistance training (Legs on Tuesday, Pull on Thursday).
- **Saturday:** Push day (upper body workout).
- **Sunday:** Active recovery (light yoga or a leisurely walk).

**8:00 AM - Breakfast**
- A nutritious breakfast to fuel your day.

**8:30 AM - Study/IT Projects**
- Focus on your IT studies or coding projects (1.5-2 hours).
- Use the Pomodoro technique (25 minutes of focused work followed by a 5-minute break).

**10:30 AM - News and Reading**
- Spend an hour reading, checking in on news, scientific magazines, or literary content.

**11:30 AM - Errands/Family Check-ins/Review Calendar and Schedule**
- Dedicate this time to handle errands, appointments, or check in with family (1 hour).

**12:00 PM - Lunch**
- Take a break and enjoy a healthy lunch.

**1:00 PM - Hobbies/Creative Time**

**4:00 PM - Socializing/Free-time**
- Hangout with friends/night out.

**Evening Routine:**
- Dinner and unwind time with friends or personal activities.
- Aim for a consistent bedtime to ensure adequate sleep.

### Tips for Managing ADHD:
1. **Time-Blocking:** Use a planner or digital calendar to block out your schedule. Color-code different activities (study, workout, social, etc.) for visual clarity.
2. **Set Boundaries:** Communicate your schedule with friends and family to help them understand when you’re available and when you need focused time.
3. **Use Reminders:** Set alarms or reminders for transitions between activities to help you stay on track.
4. **Limit Distractions:** Create a dedicated study space free from distractions, and consider using apps that block distracting websites during study time.
5. **Reflect Weekly:** Spend some time each week to reflect on what worked and what didn’t, and adjust your routine accordingly.

Feel free to tweak this schedule based on your preferences and commitments. Let me know if you need any adjustments or additional strategies!"

**Review:**
I think structura performs well in its role as a productivity assistant, particularly for users managing complex daily routines. Structura is efficient in offering relevant productivity advice based on the input received from the user. Its functionality includes personalized goal-setting, time-blocking suggestions, mindfulness and focus techniques, task management, and reminders. It maintains a consistent understanding of time management techniques, such as breaking tasks into smaller pieces, making the overall task of goal-setting seem more achievable. Structura is very user-friendly. The conversational interface feels natural and approachable, with simple prompts guiding users through various productivity strategies. The chatbot's responses are clear, concise, and actionable, which helps users understand how to implement its advice in real time. It tailors its advice based on user input, which makes it feel like a personal assistant rather than just a generic bot. Structura's tone is also consistently positive, supportive, and non-judgmental, which can help users feel more motivated and confident.I think its advice, such as time-blocking, prioritization, and mindfulness, is practical and effective for individuals looking to optimize their routines.

Structura significantly benefits users who need help managing their time and establishing structured routines. It is especially useful for individuals with ADHD, time blindness, or other similar challenges, as it offers practical tools to help them stay focused, organized, and calm. Structura also promotes well-being by incorporating mindfulness techniques that reduce stress and improve mental clarity. Structura can be an invaluable tool for any organization, particularly in enhancing employee productivity and well-being. By providing on-demand support, Structura could reduce the need for one-on-one coaching sessions or long training seminars. It can offer personalized productivity guidance to employees, boosting their efficiency and mental clarity, which may lead to better overall performance and lower levels of burnout.

Still, it does have some weaknesses. While Structura excels at time management and productivity, it struggles with understanding nuanced contexts related to emotional well-being or highly complex tasks outside its scope. For example, users experiencing emotional overwhelm might find the responses too generic or unsympathetic.
Structura’s core functionality focuses on productivity, but its conversational depth is limited. It could improve in areas like providing deeper emotional or psychological support or recognizing the complexity of different user needs.


In Conclusion, Structura is a well-designed chatbot that performs its intended functions of helping users optimize their routines and manage their time more effectively. Its main strength lies in its ability to offer personalized and practical advice on productivity, with specific strategies for those struggling with ADHD, time blindness, or general time management. The user experience is smooth, and the interface feels supportive and encouraging. However, there is room for improvement in understanding deeper emotional contexts and providing more expansive responses. Structura benefits both users and organizations by offering scalable, personalized productivity support that can lead to improved performance, focus, and work-life balance.
