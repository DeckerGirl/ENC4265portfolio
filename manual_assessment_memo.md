# Manual Assessment Memo


**MEMORANDUM**<br>
**TO:** Mr. Todd Krinsky<br>
**FROM:** A. Morgan<br>
**SUBJECT:** Recommendations for Reebok T7.8 manual<br>
**DATE:** Febuary 13th, 2025<br>

I evaluated the manual for one of your company's treadmills, the Reebok T7.8, available at [https://www.manua.ls/reebok/t7-8/manual](https://www.manua.ls/reebok/t7-8/manual).

This manual has some significant strengths. For example, I was particularly pleased and surprised to see that the instructions were available in English, German, French, Dutch, Czech, Hungarian, and Slovenian despite this being listed as an English manual. This multilingual approach broadens accessibility and ensures usability across diverse markets.

However, I identified several areas for improvement. The section explaining treadmill folding lacks clarity. The English instructions read, "PULL UP THE TREADMILL FROM TREADMILL'S REAR BY HANDS AS PICTURE SHOWN," which is grammatically incorrect and potentially confusing. Rewording it to "Pull the treadmill upward from the rear using the handles, as shown in the picture" would improve clarity.

Additionally, the manual's layout could benefit from better visual structure. The text is densely packed, making it difficult to follow step-by-step instructions. Using numbered steps, bullet points, and more consistent headings would enhance readability.

Recommendations:

- Revise unclear and grammatically incorrect instructions for clarity.

- Reformat the layout to use more white space, bullet points, and numbering.

- Maintain and highlight the multilingual options for broader market reach.
