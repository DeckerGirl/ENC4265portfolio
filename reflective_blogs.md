# Wayback Analysis
For this assignment I chose to analyze the design of a amazon webpage from 2005. 
<center><img src="Screenshot 2025-01-23 195228.png"></center>

The first thing I noticed was how crowded with information and ads Amazon’s homepage was. While the basic structure was in place—a search bar at the top center, product recommendations, and categories—everything seemed to be competing for attention. TThe top of the page had a horizontal navigation bar with categories like "Books," "Electronics," and "Clothing," but it wasn’t as intuitive or easy to navigate as current designs. I had to read everything carefully and sift through tdifferent features to find what I was looking for. I think the utilitarian fonts added to this confusion. Nothing was bolded or highlighted to stand out more in the sea of information. Maybe with the exception of promotional ads (something amazon decided placementon but not design). Otherwise the site was lacking in graphics.

The promotional bannersfeatured under product reccomendations stuck out slightly more with their white-text-on-blue back design. It detailed options, including an advertisement for Amazon’s own credit card and other promotional banners. I beleive the overwhelmingly white background used for this site's design coupled with the use of light blue text links, washes out information and makes the site difficult to navigate. There's too much white space and the text doesn't stand out enough against it.

Today, Amazon uses a cleaner, more dynamic layout that focuses more on user intent and behavior rather than overwhelming them with too many options upfront.

# Quick Start Guide
For this assignment I chose to make a quick start guide for an electric kettle. As such this quick start guide will be targeted at consumers.
<center><img src="kettle.png"></center>

Step 1: Unbock and Inspect the Kettle.
Unbox the kettle. This kettle comes with a plug-in base, a kettle body, and a top. Take off the top and inspect the kettle for any damage or dirt. Wipe it down with a damp rag to be safe.

Step 2: Find a place for your kettle and plug-in the base. 
Decide where you desire to place your kettle. Maybe you want to keep it on the kitchen counter or a table in the office breakroom. It should be a place close to an electrical outlet. Now plug in the base.

Step 3: Fill Kettle with water and heat.
Take the kettle body, remove the top, and fill with water. Place the lid back on. Now place the full kettle onto the plued-in base. Push down the button by the base of the kettle handle to start the kettle.

Step 4: Make tea or coffee.
Now that your water boiled, use it for tea or coffee in the mug of your choice!

Step 5: Maintnaince aka Descaling the Kettle.
Limescale can build up in kettles and coffe makers due to hard water. Once a month, one should fill their kettle with an inch of white vinegar ntill evaporation to break down this limescale. After this rinse out with water and use as usual.

## Assignment Rationale 
This assignment will let you experiment with a generative AI tool of your choice, and you will strengthen your critical thinking skills as you evaluate its strengths and weaknesses.

## Where to Start
Think of a product that you already know how to use. It can be a bluetooth headset, an app, a video game, a sewing machine, or anything that requires a little bit of setup to use.

## Assignment Steps
This assignment is a little more structured than others in our course, so please follow these steps:
1. Open Copilot or any other text-based generative AI tool you prefer (don't pay for it unless you happen to already have a subscription)
2. Write a prompt that asks it to generate a quick-start guide for your product of choice. (copy and paste this somewhere - it is part of what you need to turn in)
3. Evaluate the output. Try to follow the steps yourself, or at least imagine following them.
4. Prompt it again (and again) if needed (again saving your prompts somewhere).
5. Reflect on the process and write a short (200 words) reflection on the tool's strengths, weaknesses, and anything that you learned (or anything that surprised you).

## What is Due
On your portfolio, post the following:
-The name of the tool (with the link if you have it)
-Your prompts
-The best output 
-Your reflection

Prompt A: Reflect on your assigned reading this week in a detailed manner that demonstrates you read and understood the assigned reading. What can you 'take away' from this reading? What insightful concepts did you read about that can inform your own technical communication activities? 

Reflection: For this reflection, I chose to focus on the assigned reading "Eight Principles of Information Architecture" by Dan Brown, because I think it provides useful guidelines for individuals getting started in web design. The reading outlines eight principles that help shape intuitive, accessible, and scalable websites. These principles are applicable not only to web design but also to broader areas of technical communication. As a student juggling multiple web design projects this semester, I found these guidlines incredibly useful and aplicable to my other classes.

One key takeaway is the Principle of Objects, which encourages designers to view content as living entities with unique characteristics and relationships. This concept reminded me that content isn't just isolated text or images but rather information that a userbase has to actively interact with.

Another insightful principle is the Principle of Choices, which highlights the importance of offering users clear and limited options. Too many choices can overwhelm users, making navigation frustrating. I realized that when I communicate technical information, simplifying choices and focusing on clarity can improve the user's understanding and experience.

The Principle of Disclosure stood out as particularly relevant to technical communication. It suggests revealing just enough information to help users decide whether to dig deeper. This principle parallels the practice of layering technical content so readers can grasp the essentials without feeling overloaded.

The Principle of Exemplars is another useful concept, as it advocates for using examples to clarify abstract categories. I've noticed that when technical documentation includes relatable examples, it becomes much easier to comprehend.

The Principle of Front Doors reminds designers that users can enter a website from any page. This principle resonated with me because it underscores the need for consistent navigation and context across all pages. Similarly, in technical communication, each section of a document should provide enough context for readers who might jump directly to that section.

The Principle of Multiple Classification suggests offering various ways to access information, recognizing that different users have different mental models. This principle is especially important in technical documentation where diverse audiences may seek information in different ways.

The Principle of Focused Navigation advocates for organizing navigation logically without mixing categories. Clear navigation parallels clear document structure, which helps users find information more efficiently.

Finally, the Principle of Growth encourages designers to build flexible structures that can accommodate future content. This principle reminded me to consider long-term scalability when organizing technical content.

Overall, Brown's principles offer practical guidance for designing user-friendly websites and technical documents alike. I found the reading insightful and applicable to my own technical communication activities, particularly in terms of structuring content thoughtfully, simplifying information for clarity, and anticipating future needs.

Prompt C: Ask a generative AI tool (maybe one in Boodlebox or Copilot) to generate something you might have to write in your future career. Assess the result, and then revise your prompt or "stack" an additional prompt onto it (e.g., "remove the passive voice and add headings"). Congratulations, you're a prompt engineer now. Add this skill to your resume. On your website, post: 1) your original and revised prompts 2) your assessment of what it generated 3) (optional) what it generated.

Reflection: For this reflection I entered the prompt, "generate a detailed project proposal for a front-end developer working on a web application redesign" into ChatGBT stcked ith "remove passive voice and address a comapny called LuLuDesign" and I received the following project proposal.<br>
